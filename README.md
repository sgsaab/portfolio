# My Porfolio

My porfolio!

## Project Overview

This was originally made as a final project for the course CS1300 at Brown. The porfolio was meant to showcase our work from the class and convey a coherent personal brand.

The project is built with:

- HTML5 semantic structure
- CSS for styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for responsiveness

## Running To-do

- Visibility. "I bought the domain sanasaab.com and it's now working! But even when I google text that's word for word in the website, the site doesn't come up. When I google my name it doesn't come up either. Why?"
- **After grading**: replaces personas and storyboarding with url shortener. Add more technical projects.

#### Optional

- Project images dark mode (?)
- Make clouds cover projects, then part when scrolling down
- Add tags to projects (e.g: case study, design, swe)
